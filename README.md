# Time Journal (aka tj)

...it came to me in a dream...

...well, okay, not a dream, but I was definitely falling asleep at the time.  Noting that jrnl wasn't quite right, that zettlekasten had some good ideas, and that the simplicity of an ancient perl script called pjphone was quite nice.

Alas, the simplicity didn't survive so well, but hopefully this is an improvement on jrnl, and can be used for zettlekasten.

## Installation

Pypi has the latest version, so installation via `pip` or `pipx` should work.

## Usage

It's written using [click], with lots of docstrings, so `tj --help` should get you quite far.
